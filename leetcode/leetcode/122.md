# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

> https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/

> Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.
>
> Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
>
> **Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

## Approach 1 : Greedy

```c++ 
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {        
        int ret = 0;
        int profit = 0;
        for(int i=1; i<prices.size(); i++) {
            profit = prices[i] - prices[i-1];
            if(profit>0 ) ret += profit;
        }
        return ret;
    }
};
```
