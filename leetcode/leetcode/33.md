# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

> https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

> Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
>
> (i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).
>
> You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return `-1`.
>
> You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
>
> Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of *O*(log *n*).



## Approach 1 : Binary Search

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.size()-1;
        int mid = 0;
        while (right >= left){
            mid = left+(right-left)/2;
            if(nums[mid] == target){
                return mid;
            } else if(nums[mid] > target) {
                
                //rotation in right
                if(nums[left] <= nums[mid] && target < nums[left])
                    left = mid + 1;            
                else 
                    right = mid - 1;
                            
            } else if(nums[mid] < target ) {                
                //rotation in left
                if(nums[mid] <= nums[right] && target > nums[right])
                    right = mid - 1;
                else 
                    left = mid + 1;            
            }
            
        }

        return -1;
    }
};
