# 328. Odd Even Linked List

> https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/

> Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.
>
> You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode oddEvenList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode odd = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode even = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode evenHead = even;
        boolean isOdd = true;
        ListNode res = odd;
        while(head != null) {
            if(isOdd) {
                odd.next = head;
                odd = head;
            }
            else {
                even.next = head;
                even = head;
            }
            head = head.next;
            isOdd = !isOdd;
        }
        
        odd.next = evenHead.next;
        even.next = null;
        
        return res.next;
    }
    
}
