# 138. Copy List with Random Pointer

> https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/submissions/

> A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.
>
> Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list.
>
> The Linked List is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:
>
> - `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
> - `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) where random pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

## Approach 1: mix old list and new list

```c++
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* next;
    Node* random;
    
    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        next = NULL;
        random = NULL;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
public:
    Node *copyRandomList(Node *head) {
        if(!head ) return head;
        // 1. ceate nodes of new list
        Node *cur=head;
        Node *temp, *newNode;
        while(cur){
            temp = cur;
            cur = cur->next;
            
            newNode = new Node(temp->val);
            newNode->next = cur;
            temp->next = newNode;
        }
        // 2. set random of new list
        cur = head;
        while(cur){
            if(cur->random){
             	cur->next->random = cur->random->next;
            }
            cur = cur->next->next;
        }
        
        //3. set next of new list and restore next of old list
        cur = head;
        newNode = head->next;
        while(cur){
            //temp points to origial next
            temp = cur->next->next;

            if(temp){
                cur->next->next = temp->next;
            }
            else{
                cur->next->next = NULL;
            }
            
            //restore the original list
            cur->next = temp;
            cur = temp;
            
        }
        return newNode;
    }
};
```
