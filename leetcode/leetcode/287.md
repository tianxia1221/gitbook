# 287. Find the Duplicate Number

> https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/

> Given an array *nums* containing *n* + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and *n* (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

## Approach 1 : Cycle Detection - Floyd's Tortoise and Hare

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        int fast = nums[0];
        int low = nums[0];
        do {
            fast = nums[fast];
            fast = nums[fast];
            low = nums[low];
        }while(fast != low);
            
        fast = nums[0];
        while(fast != low){
            fast = nums[fast];
            low = nums[low];
        }
        return fast;  
    }
};
```
