# 11. Container With Most Water

>https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/

> Given *n* non-negative integers *a1*, *a2*, ..., *an* , where each represents a point at coordinate (*i*, *ai*). *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at (*i*, *ai*) and (*i*, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
>
> **Note:** You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.

> The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Suppose $height[ i ] <= Height[ j ]$

Because $MaxArea[i, j]$ = MaxArea( <font color=red>MaxArea[i+1, j] </font>,  <font color=Green> Area[i, j]</font> , <font color=Blue> > âˆ€ Area[i, k]  i+1<= k <= j</font>)  							    

&rArr;            $MaxArea[i, j] $= MaxArea( <font color=red>MaxArea[i+1, j] </font>,  <font color=Green> Area[i, j]</font>  )
