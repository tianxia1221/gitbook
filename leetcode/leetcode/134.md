# 134. Gas Station

> https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/

>There are *N* gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station *i* is `gas[i]`.
>
>You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from station *i* to its next station (*i*+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
>
>Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.
>
>**Note:**
>
>* If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
>* Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
>* Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.



## Approach 1: 

### Notice: 

If car starts at i and can not reach (i + j). Any station between i and (i + j) can not reach (i + j).

```java
class Solution {
	public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
		int n = gas.length;
		int[] left = new int[n];
		int sum = 0;
		int j = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			left[i] = gas[i] - cost[i];
		}

		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			sum += left[i];
		}
        // the total number of gas < the total number of cost
		if (sum < -1) return -1;

		int i = 0;
		while (i < n) {
			if (left[i] < 0) {
				i++;
				continue;
			}
            
			sum = 0;
			for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
				sum += left[(i + j) % n];
				if (sum < 0) {
					i += j; //If car starts at i and can not reach (i + j). Any station between i and (i + j) can not reach (i + j).
					break;
				}
			}
			if (j == n) return i;
		}

		return -1;
	}
}

## Approach 2 : Greedy

```c++
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
       int start = gas.length-1;
       int end = 0;
       int sum = gas[start] - cost[start];
       while (start > end) {
          if (sum >= 0) {
             sum += gas[end] - cost[end]; // consume gas to go as far as possible
             ++end;
          }
          else {
             --start;
             sum += gas[start] - cost[start]; //greedy: get more before start
          }
       }
       return sum >= 0 ? start : -1;
    }
}
```
