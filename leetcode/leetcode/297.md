# 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

> https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/

> Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
>
> Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

## Approach 1 : 

```java
public class Codec {
    private static final String spliter = ",";
    private static final String NN = "X";

    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    public String serialize(TreeNode root) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        buildString(root, sb);
        return sb.toString();
    }

    private void buildString(TreeNode node, StringBuilder sb) {
        if (node == null) {
            sb.append(NN).append(spliter);
        } else {
            sb.append(node.val).append(spliter);
            buildString(node.left, sb);
            buildString(node.right,sb);
        }
    }
    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    public TreeNode deserialize(String data) {
        Deque<String> nodes = new LinkedList<>();
        nodes.addAll(Arrays.asList(data.split(spliter)));
        return buildTree(nodes);
    }
    
    private TreeNode buildTree(Deque<String> nodes) {
        String val = nodes.remove();
        if (val.equals(NN)) return null;
        else {
            TreeNode node = new TreeNode(Integer.valueOf(val));
            node.left = buildTree(nodes);
            node.right = buildTree(nodes);
            return node;
        }
    }
}
