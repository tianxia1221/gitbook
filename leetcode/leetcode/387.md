# 387. First Unique Character in a String

https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/

> Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return it's index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

## Approach 1 : Linear 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int firstUniqChar(string s) {
        vector<int> count(256, 0);
        for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
            count[s[i]]++;
        }
        
        for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++) {
            if(count[s[i]] == 1)
                return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity : $O(n)$ since we go through the string of length N twice.
- Space complexity: $O(1)$ since we keep an array of length126 .
