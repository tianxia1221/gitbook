# 62. Unique Paths 

> https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/

> A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
>
> The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
>
> How many possible unique paths are there?

> Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

## Approach 1 : DP  Recursion

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
		vector<vector<int>> matrix(m+1, vector<int>(n+1, 0));
        return helper(m,n,matrix);
    }
    
    int helper(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>> & matrix){
        if(matrix[m][n]) return matrix[m][n];
        if(0==m || 0==n) return 0;
        if(1==m || 1==n) return 1;
        matrix[m][n] = helper(m-1,n,matrix) + helper(m, n-1,matrix);
        return matrix[m][n];
     }
};
```

## Approach 2 : DP Iterator

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    unordered_map<long,int> map;
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int> > path(m, vector<int> (n, 1));
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++)
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++)
                path[i][j] = path[i - 1][j] + path[i][j - 1];
        return path[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
};
```

> Memory Usage: 8.8 MB, less than 25.00% of C++ online submissions for Unique Paths.

## Approach 3 : Math  ?

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        long long path = 1; 
        for (int i = n; i < (m + n - 1); i++) { 
            path *= i; 
            path /= (i - n + 1); 
        } 
        return path; 
    }
};
```
